there
clamors

activities

's
the
activity
that
seems
to
accelerate
people
's
treatment
the
most
and
it
also
brings
the

a
kind
of
musical
community

show
you
a
quick
video

some
of
this
work

's
a
real
experience
,
not
only
to
learn
how

musical
memory

third
idea
i
want
to
share
with
you
is
that
music
,
paradoxically
,
i
think
even
more
than
words
,
is
one
of
the
very
best
ways
we
have
of
showing
who
we
really
are

i
love
giving
talks

strangely
i
feel
more
nervous
giving
talks
than
playing
music

were
here
playing
cello
,

playing
on
a
synth

sharing
my
music
with
you

i
'd
be
able
to
show
things
about
myself
that
i
ca
n't
tell
you
in
words
,
more
personal
things
,
perhaps
deeper
things
.
</s>
think
that
's
true
for
many
of
us
,
and
i
want
to
give
you
two
examples
of
how
music
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
interfaces
we
have
,
from
ourselves
to
the
outside
world

</s>
first
is
a
really
crazy
project
that
we
're
building
right
now
,
called
death

the
powers

it
's
a
big
opera
,
one
of
the
larger
opera
projects
going
on
in
the
world
right
now

it
's
about
a
man

rich

wants
to
live
forever

figures
out
a

the
opera

the
entire
stage

the
opera
is
about
what
we
can

pass
on

to
the
people
we
love
,
and
what

object
in

up

,
as
you
can
see
in
this
prototype

robotic
element

either
little
bows

stroke

tickle

off
on

own

they

up

robotic

when
you
put
them
all
together
,
they
turn
into
these
walls
,
which
have
the
gesture
and
the
personality
of
simon
powers

so
he
's
disappeared
,
but
the
whole
physical
environment
becomes
this
person

is
how
he
's
chosen

another
idea
with

this

legacy
through
this
very
unusual
form

through

we
're
also
making

a
way
of
each

use

images

legacy

going

shown
you
so
far

whether
it

adam

for

how

able

make
his
own
pieces

how
he
can
perform
his
piece
using
this
kind
of
personal
instrument

,
you
want
to
say
a
little
bit
about
how
you
guys
work
?
</s>
boulanger
:
yes
.
so
,
tod
and
i
entered
into
a
discussion
following
the
tewksbury
work
and
it
was
really
about
how
dan
is
an
expressive
person
,
and
he
's
an
intelligent
and
creative
person
.
and
it
's
in
his
face
,
it
's
in
his
breathing
,
it
's
in
his
eyes
.
how
come
he
ca
n't
perform
one
of
his
pieces
of
music
?
that
's
our
responsibility
,
and
it
does
n't
make
sense
.
</s>
we
started
developing
a
technology
that
will
allow
him
with
nuance
,
with
precision
,
with
control
,
and
despite
his
physical
disability
,
to
be
able
to
do
that
,
to
be
able
to
perform
his
piece
of
music
.
</s>
,
the
process
and
the
technology
--
basically
,
first
we
needed
an
engineering
solution
.
so
,
you
know
,
we
have
a
firewire
camera
,
it
looked
at
an
infrared
pointer
.
</s>
went
with
the
type
of
gesture
metaphor
that
dan
was
already
used
to
with
his
speaking
controller
.
</s>
this
was
actually
the
least
interesting
part
of
the
work
,
you
know
,
the
design
process
.
we
needed
an
input
;
we
needed
continuous
tracking
;
in
the
software
,
we
look
at
the
types
of
shapes
he
's
making
.
</s>
,
then
was
the
really
interesting
aspect
of
the
work
,
following
the
engineering
part
,
where
,
basically
,
we
're
coding
over
dan
's
shoulder
at
the
hospital
extensively
to
figure
out
,
you
know
,
how
does
dan
move
?
</s>
's
useful
to
him
as
an
expressive
motion
?
</s>
know
,
what
's
his
metaphor
for
performance
?
</s>
types
of
things
does
he
find
important
to
control
and
convey
in
a
piece
of
music
?
</s>
all
the
parameter
fitting
,
and
really
the
technology
was
stretched
at
that
point
to
fit
just
dan
.
</s>
,
you
know
,
i
think
this
is
a
perspective
shift
.
it
's
not
that
our
technologies
--
they
provide
access
,
they
allow
us
to
create
pieces
of
creative
work
.
</s>
what
about
expression
?
what
about
that
moment
when
an
artist
delivers
that
piece
of
work
?
you
know
,
do
our
technologies
allow
us
to
express
?
</s>
they
provide
structure
for
us
to
do
that
?
and
,
you
know
,
that
's
a
personal
relationship
to
expression
that
is
lacking
in
the
technological
sphere
.
so
,
you
know
,
with
dan
,
we
needed
a
new
design
process
,
a
new
engineering
process
to
sort
of
discover
his
movement
and
his
path
to
expression
that
allow
him
to
perform
.
</s>
so
that
's
what
we
'll
do
today
.
</s>
:
so
let
's
do
it
.
so
dan
do
you
want
to
tell
everyone
about
what
you
're
going
to
play
now
?

:
this
is
``
my

is
going

play
a
piece

,
called
``
my
eagle
song
''
.

fact
,
this
is
the
score
for
dan
's
piece

completely
composed
by
dan
in
hyperscore

he
can
use
his
infrared
tracker
to
go
directly

fast

faster

really
modest

can
go
in
hyperscore

start
out

making
melodies

rhythms

can
place

he
wants

one
gets
a
color

he
goes
back

window
,
draws
the
lines
,
places
everything
the
way
he
wants
to
.
looking
at
the
hyperscore
,
you
can
see
it
also
,
you
can
see
where
the
sections
are
,
something
might
continue
for
a
while
,
change
,
get
really
crazy
and
then
end
up
with
a
big
bang
at
the
end

that
's
the
way
he
made
his
piece

as
adam
says

we
then
figured
out
the
best
way

have
him
perform
his
piece

's
going

very
literal

showing
you
exactly

tracing

shows
you
the
basic
movement

shows
the
way

being
analyzed

think
it
gives
an
understanding
of
how
we
're
picking
out
movement
from
what
dan
's
doing

i
think
it
will
also
show
you
,

look
at

movement

that
when

his
motions

're
also
very
beautiful

was
asked
by
wilsonart
international
,
a
plastic
laminate
company
,
which
is
the
largest
plastic
laminate
company
in

world
--
they
asked
me
to
design
a
trade
show
booth
for
exhibition
at
the
international
contemporary
furniture
fair
in
new

,
in

</s>
looking
at
their
three
main
markets
for
their
product
which
were
basically
transportation
design
,
interiors
and
furniture
,
we
came
up
with
the
solution
of
taking
an
old
airstream
trailer
and
gutting
it
,
and
trying
to
portray
laminate
,
and
a
trailer
,
in
kind
of
a
fresh
,
new
contemporary
look
.
</s>
this
trailer
showed
up
at
my
shop

berkeley
,
i
'd
actually
never
stepped
foot
in
an
airstream
trailer
,
or
any
other
trailer
.
</s>
i
can
be
somebody
that
can
look
at
this
in
a
totally
fresh
perspective
and
see
if
i
can
optimize
it
in
its
most
idealistic
fashion
.
</s>
decided
i
had
to
do
some
research
and
really
figure
out
what
had
gone
wrong
somewhere
along
the
history
of
airstream
.
</s>
i
discovered
in
these
interiors
is
that
there
was
a
disconnect
between
the
exterior
shell
and
the
interior
architecture
of
the
pieces
.
</s>
that
the
shell
was
originally
conceived
as
a
lightweight
,
modern
,
futuristic
,
high-tech
pod
for
hurtling
down
the
freeway
,
and
the
interiors
were
completely
out
of
sync
with
that
.
</s>
fact
it
appeared
like
they
referenced
a
mountain
cabin
.
</s>
seemed
really
like
a
crisis
to
me
,
that
they
had
never
been
able
to
develop
a
vocabulary
about
escape
,
and
about
travel
,
and
modernity
in
this
trailer
that
was
consistent
with
the
shell
.
</s>
really
needed
to
do
some
archeology
in
the
trailer
itself
to
figure
out
what
's
authentic
in
an
airstream
trailer
,
and
what
feels
like
it
has
true
purpose
and
utility
.
</s>
stripped
out
all
the
vinyl
and
zolatone
paint
that
was
covering
up
this
just
fantastic
aluminum
shell
.
</s>
took
off
all
the
visible
hardware
and
trim
that
was
kind
of
doing
the
country
cabin
thing
.
</s>
literally
drew
on
the
walls
of
the
trailer
,
mocked
it
up
in
cardboard
,
we
'd
come
in
and
cut
,
decide
things
were
wrong
,
pull
it
out
,
put
it
back
in
.
</s>
main
goal
was
to
smooth
out
the
interior
,
and
begin
to
speak
about
motion
,
and
mobility
,
and
independence
.
</s>
biggest
difficulty
on
one
of
these
trailers
is
that
when
you
're
designing
there
's
actually
no
logical
place
to
stop
and
start
materials
because
of
the
continuous
form
of
the
trailer
.
</s>
's
no
such
things
as
two
walls
and
a
ceiling
coming
together
,
where
you
can
change
materials
and
shapes
.
</s>
that
became
a
challenge
.
</s>
that
,
the
material
of
choice
,
laminate
,
that
i
was
trying
to
highlight
,
only
bends
in
two
dimensions
.
</s>
's
a
compound
curve
interior
.
</s>
i
had
to
devise
was
a
way
of
fooling
the
eye
into
believing
that
all
these
panels
are
curved
with
the
shell
.
</s>
i
came
up
with
was
a
series
of
second
skins
that
basically
float
over
the
aluminum
shell
.
</s>
what
i
was
trying
to
do
there
was
direct
your
eye
in
the
space
,
so
that
you
would
perceive
the
geometry
in
a
different
way
,
and
that
the
casework
would
n't
break
up
the
space
.
</s>
also
gave
us
a
way
to
run
power
and
rewire
the
trailer
without
tearing
out
the
skin
,
so
they
function
as
an
electrical
chase
.

's
the
trailer

pretty
much
finished
