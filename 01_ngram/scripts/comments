I think I will try to remove the singletons. As of now, I dont see any issue with the script but my numbers are pretty low (7.6) which is bad.
  
Removing singletons improves it to 8.54. Something is definitely wrong.

I see that I am including stop symbols in calculations. I think it is due to bad coding of while b < len(line) -1: Correcting this by adding line to eliminate if last is stop symbol improved it to 9.36512599379. Still something is off.

Dividing the MLE by the sentence length  made  it to 65.5218558921

I rewrote this as a class. The sentence level perplexity seems to be making sense. I will try getting the corpus stats.
I think I am messing the denominator up.
